### About Me ðŸ¦Š
- **My name is Justin**, I'm a 20 year old Tech enthusiast who is currently having their Piscine at 42.
- **Programming for about 3 years**, my journey started on Roblox where I exploited security vulnerabilities in experiences and eventually branched out to doing basic Pentesting for developers who had no experience in this field.
- **My greatest achievement** was discovering a vulnerability in some RemoteEvents that allowed Exploiters to remove other players' Data in an experience that now has **7 Million visits!**
